Hello there! I'm James, a graduate student at the University of Southern California in the MET group. My research interests lie in optoelectronic materials for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Finding good candidates for these purposes can be difficult, so I am interested in utilizing machine learning to discover such materials (such as stable blue emitters for OLEDs, and near infrared absorbers for OPVs). Outside of research I enjoy exploring new locations, photography, finding cool breweries, and reading!
